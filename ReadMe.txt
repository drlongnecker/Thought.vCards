*START NOTE:* This project was forked from https://github.com/drlongnecker/Thought.vCards and created to supply a dotnet core support to this great library.
I have an PullRequest on project, but until this was accepted I use this fork to maintain and create an Nuget package to support dotnet core and run this on my Linux environment.

vCard Class Library for .NET (Version 0.4; LGPL license)
Copyright (c) 2007-2009 David Pinch * http://www.thoughtproject.com/Libraries/vCard/

Introduction

    This is a simple library for manipulating vCards.  A vCard is used to exchange
    contact information (e.g. to import into Microsoft Outlook or download from
    the web into a suitable PIM application).  All code is released under the LGPL
    for free use and with full permission to use with commercial software.

General Design:

    (a) The vCard object model is separated from the various vCard file formats.
        You can manipulate contact information, photos, and other properties in the
        standard way you would expect from a .NET class library.

    (b) Almost all vCard properties can exist multiple times in a vCard file.
        However, some judgement is used when determining whether a property
        should be implemented as a collection or a singular property.  For
        example, it is possible to have multiple formatted names, each in a 
        different language.  The need for this functionality is very rare
        and therefore the formatted name property is implemented as a string
        property rather than collection of "formatted name" objects.

        On the other hand, multiple email addresses are common.  Email addresses
        are stored in a collection.  Nevertheless, feel free to request changes
        if you believe singular property should be converted to a collection.

    (c) The vCardReader and vCardWriter classes are abstract classes that
        define the interfaces for reading and writing vCard formats.  This
        version of the library supplies vCardStandardReader and vCardStandardWriter,
        which implement the vCard 2.1 format specification.

        A future version will include support for Jabber, RDF and hCard formats.
        If you want to help evolve the library, adding support for those
        formats will be appreciated.

    (d) Example usage (in VB.NET; the library itself is in C#):

          Dim card As New vCard()
 
          card.GivenName = "David"
          card.FamilyName = "Pinch"
        
          Dim photo as New vCardPhoto( _
              "http://www.thoughtproject.com/Common/me.jpg")
 
          card.Photos.Add(photo)

          Dim writer as vCardStandardWriter = New vCardStandardWriter()

          writer.EmbedWebPhotos = true
          writer.Write(card, "c:\davepinch.vcf")

        Samples demonstrating use the library. 


Current Status

    This is version 0.4 of the library.  It implements a substantial portion of the
    vCard standard.  Future efforts will focus on compatible formats like
    hCard and RDF.  However, the library is still treated as beta status.
    Please do not use on production systems unless you are confident with the
    degree of functionality currently implemented.
